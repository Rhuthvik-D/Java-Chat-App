Hello, This is our JAVA CHATAPP! 
By Hemaksh Chaturvedi (hac9624) and Rhuthvik Dendukuri (rd3377)

With this application we can open multiple client windows and one singular server to text and send broadcasts to all online users.

The purpose of this project is to create a secure logging chat for a closed network such as a company whose employees work on a cloud or VM system. Using this chatapp the employees can send their daily work log and scrum updates to the server and have it saved in the server. 

If they ever need to see the previous updates or broadcast they can ask the server admin to retrieve their chats and send it back to the them.

We will showcase this functionality in this demonstration.

- First we launch, 'Server/Main.java'. This will initiate the server.

- Now we will launch 'Client/Main.java'. You can run as many clients as needed. They will all be connected to the Server app.

- Now that client side and server are both open we can either choose to register a new user or use existing login. 

- In the first client window we have registered a new user.

- In the second client window we have logged in as 'testuser'

- We will send messages from both client. This is visible as a broadcast to other online users and the server

- We will now showcase the servers ability to retrieve chats

- Now that the chat is retrieved we will send the chat back to the user

THANK YOU
